# Portfolio-Project
My responsive portfolio web page

ABOUT
Hi! You're about to see how I built a website to showcase my portfolio! Feel free to explore the projects as I add them.

FEATURES
This is a fun responsive website built with a flexbox design to make it responsive no matter what device you use.
Let me know what you think of it!

USING THIS SITE
View the website by opening the index file and running the code. I'm looking forward to hearing your feedback.

KNOWN ISSUES
Here are two big issues that need to be fixed: 
1. My files are not saved in a way that any computer other than mine can get to the images and stylesheets. How can I save them in a place that everyone who runs the index file will see the images and styling?

2. When I try to validate the code, they say that there are bad characters in the code - %, \, etc. How do I get rid of those characters?
